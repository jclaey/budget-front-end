# budget-front-end
Simple, front-end budget app keeps track of expenses and income and compares it with user's budget. The app enables users to create budget categories and spending limits for those categories as well as track expenses by category and income for each month. Users can then filter and track their financial data by a specific month and year, a specific month (e.g. all October months), a specific year (e.g. all data for 2023), or all-time (all data for the life of their use of the application).
